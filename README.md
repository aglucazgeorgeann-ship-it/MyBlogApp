Installation
Clone the repository:

Install Frontend Dependencies:

# If your frontend is in a separate 'client' or 'frontend' folder
cd client # or frontend

cd ..

Install Backend Dependencies:

# If your backend is in a separate 'server' or 'backend' folder
cd server # or backend
npm install # or yarn install OR pip install -r requirements.txt (for Python)

Database Setup:

Create a database named myblogapp_db (or whatever you prefer).

Update your [Backend Framework] configuration/environment variables with your database credentials.
